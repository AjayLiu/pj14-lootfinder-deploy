## Retro Assessment

I started by asking everyone on the team what they are currently working on and how that is going. I do this to potentially spark more ideas on how the team has been doing and what should change. Then, I started the start/stop/continue template. I ask each team member what they think about what we should start/stop/continue doing.

In my opinion, the restrospective went well. Everyone was very forthcoming with their thoughts about our performance in the last sprint and changes they felt should me made.

I recommend continuing the start/stop/continue template, as it is very easy to digest, yet effective in identifying what went well and what should we should change going forward.

## Experiment/Change

Our group decided on experimenting with creating more detailed/descriptive PRs and branch names in order to address the issue of long wait times for PRs to get merged to main. Previously, we stated that branch names should only be a number, indicating the associated issue in the Kanban board. In this meeting, we came to the conclusion that this, along with less descriptive PRs at times, contributed to longer PR approval times. In this next sprint, we will include more detailed descriptions in our PRs, and we will format our titles (more or less) as follows: XX-descriptor1-desccriptor2.
