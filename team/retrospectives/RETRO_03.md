# Retro Outcomes

For this retrospective, I used the Start/Stop/Continue outline as well as an overall group discussion. I think that the process went well, and we were able to generate helpful ideas that will allow us to finish our project strong.

Report:
* successes: 2 man PR system, revamped branch naming
* goals: More testing, improve version control (conflicts between branches), create more objects instead of repeating code
* a commitment: Clean up Kanban Board - remove things we aren't going to finish, stalled items, etc
