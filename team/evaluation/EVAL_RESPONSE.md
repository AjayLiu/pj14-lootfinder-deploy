## How effective it was to use the project in its current state (comments about the robustness of the app and the current UI/UX design)
The app's colorful main page and interesting logo are appreciated. A recommendation is to hide entries like "My Offers" and "Inbox" for users who aren't logged in. The UI/UX design is simple yet effective, with icons that work well, but thereâ€™s a need for something that would incentivize users to choose this app over competitors like Facebook Marketplace. The project shows potential, but improvements are still needed in terms of features and user engagement.

## A summary of how the other team was able to follow the deployment instructions and how helpful / organized the other team found your team's repo (README.md, Kanban Board, maybe code).
ReadME is good and works well, Kanban Board can be optimized to remove unused columns.

## The other team's final closing thoughts: something they liked, the most impactful opportunity for improvement, and one more thing they thought was good.
Team seems aware of most issues. Not sure about plans for dashboard. Probably low priority, but would like to see a better UI/UX. Possibly show items that you have made offers/negotiations on.
