# Problem Scenario - Loot Finder

Meet Ajay, a broke college student in Santa Barbara looking for an affordable used bike to replace his old one which just broke. He searched on Facebook Marketplace for a good deal, but was flooded with bike posts from all the way out in Santa Maria and Oxnard, despite searching for “local” posts. He contacted multiple buyers, but had to cancel many deals to pickup locations not being close to a bus stop (he does not have a car to transport the new bike). 

Loot Finder solves this by offering a map-based app, letting users easily find and filter nearby items, saving time and reducing frustration.
