# Michael:
- Used Github Copilot to try and debug problem with Google Maps Vue wrapper.
- Copilot couldn't understand or didn't know the syntax for the specific wrapper and gave solutions that didn't work with our tech stack.
- Some of the solutions were entirely incorrect or would compile but no solve the problem.
- The problem ended up being a formatting issue, which Copilot couldn't detect.
